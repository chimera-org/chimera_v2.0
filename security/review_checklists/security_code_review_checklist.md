## üîç Purpose

This checklist provides a structured approach for conducting security-focused code reviews within the Chimera project. It is designed to identify common security vulnerabilities, ensure adherence to secure coding practices, and verify that security requirements are properly implemented.

## üìù Instructions

1. This checklist should be used for all code reviews involving:
   - Security-critical components
   - Code that processes patient data
   - External-facing interfaces
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Any code changes that modify the security posture

2. For each item, mark as:
   - ‚úÖ Pass: Requirement fully satisfied
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: Requirement partially satisfied, needs improvement
   - ‚ùå Fail: Requirement not satisfied, must be addressed
   - N/A: Not applicable to the code being reviewed

3. Document all findings, including:
   - Line numbers and file paths for identified issues
   - Severity assessment (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Recommended remediation steps
