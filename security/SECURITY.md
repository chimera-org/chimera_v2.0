## üéØ Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

This Security Policy establishes the overarching principles, requirements, and responsibilities for protecting the Chimera neural interface system, its data, and associated resources. It provides a framework for implementing security controls that protect patient safety, maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Scope

This policy applies to:

- All software and hardware components of the Chimera neural interface system
- All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and other workers
- All data processed, stored, or transmitted by the Chimera system
- All physical and virtual environments used for development, testing, and production
- All third-party vendors and partners with access to Chimera systems or data

## üîí Security Principles

The Chimera project is guided by the following core security principles:

1. **Patient Safety First**: Security controls must prioritize patient safety above all other considerations.
2. **Security by Design**: Security must be integrated throughout the development lifecycle, not added as an afterthought.
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls must be implemented to protect against various threats.
4. **Least Privilege**: Access to systems and data must be limited to the minimum necessary to perform required functions.
5. **Privacy by Default**: Data protection must be the default state for all systems and processes.
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Security posture must be regularly assessed and improved to address evolving threats.
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: All security measures must align with relevant regulatory requirements.
8. **Shared Responsibility**: Security is the responsibility of all team members, not just the security team.
