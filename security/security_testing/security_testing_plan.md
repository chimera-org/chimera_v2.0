- Hardware-software interfaces
- External communication interfaces
- User interfaces and administrative controls
- Third-party components and libraries
- Deployment configurations

- Access: Development team only

### Testing Environment

- Purpose: Comprehensive security testing before staging
- Configuration: Near-production settings
- Data: Anonymized test data
- Access: QA and security teams

### Staging Environment

- Purpose: Final verification in production-like environment
- Configuration: Production-identical settings
- Data: Fully anonymized or synthetic data
- Access: QA, security, and operations teams

### Production Environment

- Purpose: Limited security verification and monitoring

## üìä Risk-Based Testing Approach

Security testing efforts are prioritized based on risk assessment:

### Critical Risk Areas (Highest Priority)

- Patient data protection mechanisms
- Neural signal processing integrity
- Authentication and authorization systems
- External communication interfaces
- Medical device control systems

### High Risk Areas

- Administrative interfaces
- Logging and monitoring systems
- Update and maintenance mechanisms
- Local data storage
- User interface components

### Medium Risk Areas

- Non-patient data processing
- Reporting functionality
- Development and debugging interfaces
- Internal APIs
- Documentation systems

### Low Risk Areas

- Static informational content
- Non-sensitive configuration data
- Training materials
- Help systems

## üìù Testing Procedures

### Pre-Testing Activities

1. Review security requirements and threat models
2. Update test cases based on recent changes
3. Prepare test environment and data
4. Verify testing tools are updated
5. Obtain necessary approvals for testing

### Testing Execution

1. Execute automated security scans
2. Perform manual security testing
3. Document all findings with evidence
4. Classify vulnerabilities by severity
