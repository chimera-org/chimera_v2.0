## üéØ Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

This Security Architecture Overview document provides a comprehensive description of the security architecture for the Chimera neural interface system. It defines the security principles, components, controls, and relationships that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data, with special emphasis on patient safety and regulatory compliance.

### Scope

This document covers:

- Security architecture principles and objectives
- Security domains and boundaries
- Security controls and mechanisms
- Data protection architecture
- Authentication and authorization architecture
- Secure communication architecture
- Security monitoring and incident response architecture
- Regulatory compliance considerations

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Principles

The Chimera security architecture is built on the following core principles:

### 1. Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect critical assets, ensuring that the compromise of a single control does not lead to a complete security failure.

### 2. Least Privilege

Access to system components and data is granted based on the minimum level necessary to perform required functions, reducing the potential impact of compromised accounts.

### 3. Secure by Design

Security is integrated into the system architecture from the beginning, not added as an afterthought, ensuring that security considerations influence all design decisions.

### 4. Zero Trust

All access requests are verified regardless of source, with continuous validation throughout the session, eliminating implicit trust based on network location or prior authentication.

### 5. Privacy by Design

Privacy protections are built into the system architecture, ensuring that personal and health data is protected throughout its lifecycle.

### 6. Fail Secure

System components are designed to fail in a secure state, ensuring that security is maintained even during failure conditions.

### 7. Regulatory Compliance

The architecture is designed to meet or exceed all applicable regulatory requirements, including FDA, CDSCO, and data protection regulations.

### 8. Patient Safety First

Security controls are implemented in a way that prioritizes patient safety, ensuring that security measures do not interfere with critical medical functions.

## üîç Security Domains

The Chimera security architecture is organized into the following security domains:

### 1. Clinical Domain

- Handles de-identified or synthetic data
- Supports experimentation and innovation
- Isolated from clinical systems

### 3. Administrative Domain

- Contains business and administrative functions
- Manages user accounts and access control
- Handles non-clinical operations
- Separated from clinical systems

### 4. External Domain

- Contains interfaces to external systems
- Implements strict boundary controls
- Manages all external communications
