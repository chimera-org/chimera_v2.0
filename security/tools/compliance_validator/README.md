- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies gaps in compliance documentation and implementation
- **Documentation Verification**: Verifies the completeness and accuracy of compliance documentation
- **Traceability Analysis**: Ensures traceability between requirements, design, implementation, and testing
- **Automated Compliance Checks**: Performs automated checks against compliance criteria
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates comprehensive compliance reports for regulatory submissions
- **Continuous Compliance Monitoring**: Monitors ongoing compliance status
