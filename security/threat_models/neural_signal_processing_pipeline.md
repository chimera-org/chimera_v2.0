### System Description

The Neural Signal Processing Pipeline is a critical component of the Chimera platform that processes raw neural signals from implanted electrodes, filters and analyzes the data, and translates it into control signals for external devices. The pipeline consists of several stages:

1. **Signal Acquisition**: Receives raw neural signals from the electrode interface
2. **Signal Preprocessing**: Filters noise and artifacts from the raw signals
3. **Feature Extraction**: Identifies relevant features in the neural signals
4. **Classification**: Interprets neural patterns into specific commands
5. **Command Translation**: Converts classified patterns into device control signals
