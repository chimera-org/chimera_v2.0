## 🎯 Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

This Incident Response Policy establishes the framework for effectively managing security incidents that may affect the Chimera neural interface system. It defines the principles, responsibilities, and procedures for detecting, reporting, assessing, responding to, and recovering from security incidents in a way that minimizes damage, reduces recovery time and costs, and protects patient safety.

### Scope

This policy applies to:

- All security incidents that may affect the Chimera neural interface system
- All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and other workers
- All systems, networks, applications, and data owned or managed by Chimera
- All environments, including development, testing, and production
- All third parties that access or process data on behalf of Chimera
