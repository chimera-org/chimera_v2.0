## üéØ Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

This Access Control Policy establishes the requirements for managing and controlling access to Chimera systems, data, and resources. It defines the principles, responsibilities, and procedures for ensuring that access is granted based on the principle of least privilege and that appropriate controls are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Chimera assets.

### Scope

This policy applies to:

- All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and other workers at Chimera
- All systems, networks, applications, and data owned or managed by Chimera
- All access methods, including physical access, network access, and remote access
- All environments, including development, testing, and production

## üîí Policy Statements

### 1. Access Control Principles

1.1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Access rights and privileges shall be granted based on the minimum level necessary to perform job functions.

1.2. **Need-to-Know**: Access to information shall be granted only to individuals who require it to perform their job functions.

1.3. **Segregation of Duties**: Critical functions shall be divided among different individuals to prevent any single individual from having excessive control over a process.

1.4. **Default Deny**: Access shall be denied by default and explicitly granted only when necessary.

### 2. User Access Management

2.1. **User Registration and Deregistration**

- A formal user registration and deregistration process shall be implemented for granting and revoking access to all systems and services.
- User IDs shall be unique and personally identifiable.
- User accounts shall not be created until the appropriate approval process has been completed.
- User accounts shall be promptly disabled or removed when no longer required.

2.2. **Privilege Management**

- The allocation and use of privileged access rights shall be restricted and controlled.
- Privileged access rights shall be allocated to users on a need-to-use basis.
- A formal authorization process shall be implemented for all privileged access rights.
- Privileged accounts shall not be used for routine activities.

2.3. **User Authentication**

- All users shall be authenticated before accessing Chimera systems or data.
- Multi-factor authentication shall be implemented for all privileged accounts and for access to sensitive systems or data.
- Authentication credentials shall be transmitted and stored in a secure manner.
- Default passwords shall be changed before systems are put into operation.

2.4. **Password Management**

- Passwords shall meet complexity requirements as defined in the Password Standards document.
- Passwords shall be changed at regular intervals and when there is indication of compromise.
- Password history shall be maintained to prevent reuse of recent passwords.
- Temporary passwords shall be securely communicated to users and changed at first login.

### 3. Access Control Implementation

3.1. **Network Access Control**

- Access to networks and network services shall be controlled.
- Remote access shall be secured using encryption and multi-factor authentication.
- Network segmentation shall be implemented to separate different security domains.
- Firewall rules shall be implemented based on the principle of least privilege.

3.2. **Application and Information Access Control**

- Access to application functions shall be restricted according to defined access control policies.
- Sensitive systems shall have dedicated (isolated) computing environments.
- Access to source code shall be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Data classification shall guide access control decisions for information.

3.3. **Mobile Device Access Control**

- A mobile device policy shall be implemented to manage risks associated with mobile devices.
- Mobile devices accessing Chimera systems or data shall be enrolled in a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution.
- Encryption shall be implemented for data stored on mobile devices.
- Remote wipe capability shall be enabled for all mobile devices accessing Chimera systems or data.

### 4. Access Review and Monitoring

4.1. **Access Rights Review**

- User access rights shall be reviewed at regular intervals and after any changes in role or employment status.
- Privileged access rights shall be reviewed more frequently than regular access rights.
- Managers shall be responsible for reviewing access rights for their team members.
- Discrepancies identified during reviews shall be promptly addressed.

4.2. **Access Monitoring and Logging**

- Access to systems and data shall be logged and monitored.
- Logs shall include user identification, timestamp, and activity details.
- Logs shall be protected against tampering and unauthorized access.
- Unusual or suspicious access attempts shall be investigated.

### 5. Physical Access Control

5.1. **Secure Areas**
