## üîç Purpose

This glossary provides standardized definitions for security terminology used throughout the Chimera project documentation. It ensures consistent understanding of security concepts across all teams and stakeholders.

## üî§ Terminology

### A

#### Access Control
The process of granting or denying specific requests for obtaining and using information and related information processing services.

#### Authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system.

#### Authorization
The process of granting access rights and privileges to users, applications, or processes.

#### Availability
The property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity.

### B

#### Biometric Authentication
Authentication that uses biological characteristics (such as fingerprints, retina patterns, or facial features) to verify a person's identity.

#### Breach
An incident that results in the confirmed disclosure of data to an unauthorized party.

### C

#### CDSCO
Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, the national regulatory body for Indian pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

#### CERT-In
Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, the national agency for responding to computer security incidents.

#### CIA Triad
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability; the three core principles of information security.

#### Confidentiality
The property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.

#### Cryptography
The practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries.

#### Cybersecurity
The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.

### D

#### Data Encryption
The process of converting data from a readable format into an encoded format that can only be read or processed after it's been decrypted.

#### Data Integrity
The property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner since it was created, transmitted, or stored.

#### Defense in Depth
A security strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls throughout a system.

#### Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA)
Indian legislation enacted in 2023 that governs the processing of digital personal data in India.

### E

#### Encryption
The process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.

#### Endpoint Security
The process of securing various endpoints on a network, often defined as end-user devices such as mobile devices, laptops, and desktop PCs.

### F

#### FDA
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the regulatory body responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices.

#### Firewall
A network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.

### H

#### HIPAA
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, U.S. legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information.

#### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
A physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions for digital signatures, strong authentication, and other cryptographic functions.

### I

#### IEC 62304
International standard for medical device software lifecycle processes.

#### Incident Response
The organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or attack.

#### Information Security Management System (ISMS)
A set of policies and procedures for systematically managing an organization's sensitive data.

#### Integrity
The property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner.

#### ISO 27001
International standard for information security management systems.

### L

#### Least Privilege
The principle of providing only the minimum levels of access or permissions needed to perform a function.

### M

#### Malware
Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

#### Medical Device Rules, 2017
Indian legislation that regulates the clinical investigation, manufacture, import, sale, and distribution of medical devices in India.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
An authentication method that requires two or more verification factors to gain access.

### N

#### Network Security
The practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.

#### NIST
National Institute of Standards and Technology, a U.S. federal agency that develops technology, metrics, and standards.

### O

#### OWASP
Open Web Application Security Project, a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.

### P

#### Penetration Testing
An authorized simulated attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system.

#### Personal Health Information (PHI)
Information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual.

#### Principle of Least Privilege
The practice of limiting access rights for users to the bare minimum permissions they need to perform their work.

### R

#### Risk Assessment
The process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risk.

#### Risk Management
The coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk.

### S

#### SaMD (Software as a Medical Device)
Software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device.

#### Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)
A process that helps developers build more secure software and address security compliance requirements while reducing development cost.

#### Secure Coding
The practice of developing computer software in a way that guards against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities.

#### Security by Design
An approach to software and hardware development that seeks to make systems as free of vulnerabilities and impervious to attack as possible through such measures as continuous testing, authentication safeguards, and adherence to best programming practices.

#### Security Control
A safeguard or countermeasure prescribed for an information system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information and to meet a set of defined security requirements.

#### Security Incident
A violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.

#### Security Testing
The process of assessing and testing a system to discover security risks and vulnerabilities of the system and its data.

#### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
A formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software.

#### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
A type of security testing that analyzes application source code, byte code, or binary code for security vulnerabilities.

### T

#### Threat
A potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system or organization.

#### Threat Model
A structured representation of all the information that affects the security of an application.

#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
A security process in which the user provides two different authentication factors to verify themselves.

### V

#### Vulnerability
A weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system.

#### Vulnerability Assessment
The process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system.

### Z

#### Zero Trust
A security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access.
