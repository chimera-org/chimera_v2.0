# Secure Coding Guidelines for Chimera Project

## Introduction

This document establishes comprehensive secure coding guidelines for the Chimera project, ensuring that all software development activities adhere to the highest security standards. These guidelines are designed to protect patient safety, maintain data integrity, and ensure regulatory compliance while enabling innovation and efficiency in our development processes.

As a medical device software project, Chimera must meet stringent security requirements from both Indian and international regulatory bodies. These guidelines integrate best practices from industry standards including OWASP, IEC 62304, FDA guidance, and CDSCO requirements to create a robust security framework appropriate for a neural interface system.

## Core Security Principles

The Chimera project adheres to the following core security principles:

1. **Security by Design**: Security must be integrated from the earliest stages of development, not added as an afterthought.
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls must be implemented to protect against various attack vectors.
3. **Least Privilege**: Components should operate with the minimum privileges necessary to perform their functions.
4. **Secure Defaults**: All software configurations must be secure by default, requiring explicit action to reduce security.
5. **Input Validation**: All input must be validated before processing to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
6. **Fail Securely**: When failures occur, systems must default to a secure state that protects patient safety and data.
7. **Complete Mediation**: Access to every object must be checked for authorization prior to use.
8. **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations should require multiple approvals to prevent malicious actions by a single actor.
9. **Simplicity**: Security designs should be as simple as possible to reduce the attack surface and enable thorough review.
10. **Open Design**: Security should not depend on secrecy of design or implementation (no security through obscurity).

## Regulatory Framework
