## üîÑ Decision-Making Process

### 4.1 Technical Decisions

Technical decisions follow a consensus-seeking process:

1. **Proposal**: Any contributor can propose a technical change by creating an issue or pull request.
2. **Discussion**: The proposal is discussed openly, with feedback from relevant stakeholders.
3. **Refinement**: The proposal is refined based on feedback.
4. **Decision**: The decision is made by consensus among the relevant Working Group or TSC.
5. **Implementation**: Once approved, the change is implemented and reviewed.

For significant architectural or design decisions, a formal RFC (Request for Comments) process is used:

1. Create an RFC document in the `rfcs/` directory
2. Submit it as a pull request
3. Gather feedback from the community and relevant stakeholders
4. Refine the RFC based on feedback
5. TSC reviews and approves or rejects the RFC
6. If approved, the RFC is merged and implementation can begin

### 4.2 Strategic Decisions

Strategic decisions about project direction, priorities, and resource allocation are made by the Core Team. The process includes:

1. **Input Gathering**: Collecting input from Working Groups, TSC, and external stakeholders
2. **Analysis**: Analyzing options and their implications
3. **Proposal**: Developing a proposal for discussion
4. **Review**: Reviewing the proposal with key stakeholders
5. **Decision**: Making a decision by consensus, with the CEO having final authority
6. **Communication**: Communicating the decision to all stakeholders

### 4.3 Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise, they are resolved through the following process:

1. **Direct Discussion**: Parties involved attempt to resolve the conflict directly.
2. **Mediation**: If direct discussion fails, a neutral third party mediates.
3. **Working Group Review**: If mediation fails, the relevant Working Group reviews the conflict.
4. **TSC Review**: If the Working Group cannot resolve the conflict, the TSC reviews it.
5. **Core Team Decision**: If the TSC cannot resolve the conflict, the Core Team makes the final decision.

## üìä Project Management

### 5.1 Development Process

The Chimera project follows a structured development process:

1. **Planning**: Requirements gathering, feature prioritization, and sprint planning
2. **Design**: Architecture and detailed design, including formal review
3. **Implementation**: Coding, unit testing, and code review
4. **Testing**: Integration testing, system testing, and validation
5. **Release**: Version control, release notes, and deployment
6. **Maintenance**: Bug fixes, updates, and continuous improvement

### 5.2 Issue Management

Issues are tracked in the GitHub issue tracker and categorized as:

- **Bug**: A defect in the existing functionality
- **Feature**: A new feature or enhancement
