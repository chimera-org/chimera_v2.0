# Errors/Warnings to ignore:
# E501: line too long (handled by black)
# W503: line break before binary operator (black prefers this)
# E203: whitespace before ':' (conflicts with black)
# F401: unused import (useful during development, but can enable later)
# F841: unused local variable (useful during development, but can enable later)

# Max line length (redundant if using black, but good practice)
