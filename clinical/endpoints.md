## 📝 Endpoint Measurement Methodologies

### Motor Function Assessment

The Modified Motor Assessment Scale (MMAS) will be used to assess motor function. This scale evaluates:

1. **Upper Arm Function**: Movement quality and range
2. **Hand Movements**: Grasping and manipulation
3. **Advanced Hand Activities**: Fine motor control
4. **General Tonus**: Muscle tone and spasticity
5. **Gait**: Walking ability and quality (if applicable)

Assessment will be performed by trained clinical evaluators who have completed standardized training. Inter-rater reliability will be established prior to study initiation.

### Neural Control Assessment

The Standardized Neural Control Task Battery includes:

1. **Target Acquisition**: Moving a cursor to targets on a screen
2. **Object Manipulation**: Grasping and moving virtual objects
3. **Sequence Execution**: Performing predefined sequences of actions
4. **Sustained Control**: Maintaining a specific control state
5. **Adaptive Control**: Responding to changing task requirements

Performance metrics include accuracy, completion time, path efficiency, and stability of control.
