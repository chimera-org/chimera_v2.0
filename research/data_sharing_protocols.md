# Data Sharing Protocols for Chimera Project

## Introduction

This document establishes comprehensive protocols for data sharing within the Chimera project and with external collaborators. These protocols ensure that all data sharing activities comply with Indian and international regulatory requirements, protect patient privacy, maintain data integrity, and promote scientific collaboration while adhering to the highest ethical standards.

## Guiding Principles

The Chimera project's data sharing protocols are guided by the following principles:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: All data sharing must comply with applicable regulations including India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) 2023, HIPAA, GDPR, and CDSCO requirements for medical devices.
2. **Privacy Protection**: Patient and participant privacy must be safeguarded through appropriate de-identification and consent procedures.
3. **Scientific Integrity**: Data sharing practices must maintain the integrity, quality, and reproducibility of scientific research.
4. **Ethical Responsibility**: Data sharing must adhere to ethical principles and respect the rights and interests of all stakeholders.
5. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of data provenance, processing methods, and limitations must accompany all shared data.
6. **Accessibility**: Data should be made as openly accessible as possible while respecting privacy, security, and intellectual property constraints.
