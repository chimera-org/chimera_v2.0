# Citation Guidelines for Chimera Project

## Introduction

This document outlines the standardized citation guidelines for the Chimera project, ensuring consistent and accurate attribution of research, code, data, and other resources across all project-related publications and documentation. Proper citation practices are essential for maintaining scientific integrity, acknowledging intellectual contributions, and enabling reproducibility in research.

## General Citation Principles

The Chimera project adheres to the following core principles for all citations:

1. **Accuracy**: All citations must accurately represent the original source material.
2. **Completeness**: Citations must include all necessary information for readers to locate the original source.
3. **Consistency**: A uniform citation style must be maintained throughout all project documentation.
4. **Transparency**: The relationship between cited work and the current research must be clearly articulated.
5. **Accessibility**: When possible, citations should include persistent identifiers (DOIs, URIs) to ensure long-term access.

## Self-Citation and Project Attribution

When publishing work that builds upon or utilizes the Chimera platform:

1. Include a citation to the main Chimera project repository
2. Specify the version of Chimera used
3. Acknowledge specific components or modules utilized
4. Include a statement in the acknowledgments section recognizing the Chimera project's contribution

Example acknowledgment:
"This research utilized the Chimera v2.0 platform (https://github.com/chimera-org/chimera_v2.0), an open-source neural interface system designed for medical applications, developed in India with compliance to Indian Medical Device Rules, 2017."

## Citation Management

The Chimera project recommends using citation management software such as Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote to maintain consistent citations. Project-specific citation styles are available in the `/docs/citation_styles/` directory.

## Open Access and Preprints

The Chimera project encourages:

1. Citing the final published version of a paper when available
2. Including DOIs for all citations when available
3. Using preprint server citations (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, etc.) when the final publication is not yet available
4. Prioritizing open access resources when possible
5. Supporting Indian open access initiatives such as the Indian Open Access Repository

## Regulatory and Compliance Citations

For regulatory compliance documentation:

1. Always cite the most current version of regulatory standards
2. Include the effective date of regulatory guidance
3. Specify the regulatory jurisdiction (CDSCO, FDA, EMA, etc.)
4. Note any specific sections or paragraphs referenced
5. For Indian regulations, cite the Gazette notification number when available

## India-Specific Citation Guidelines
