# Citation Guidelines for Chimera Project

## Introduction

This document outlines the standardized citation guidelines for the Chimera project, ensuring consistent and accurate attribution of research, code, data, and other resources across all project-related publications and documentation. Proper citation practices are essential for maintaining scientific integrity, acknowledging intellectual contributions, and enabling reproducibility in research.

## General Citation Principles

The Chimera project adheres to the following core principles for all citations:

1. **Accuracy**: All citations must accurately represent the original source material.
2. **Completeness**: Citations must include all necessary information for readers to locate the original source.
3. **Consistency**: A uniform citation style must be maintained throughout all project documentation.
4. **Transparency**: The relationship between cited work and the current research must be clearly articulated.
5. **Accessibility**: When possible, citations should include persistent identifiers (DOIs, URIs) to ensure long-term access.

## Citation Formats

### Software and Code Citation

When citing the Chimera software or specific components:

```
Chimera Project. (YYYY). Chimera v[version number] [Software]. https://github.com/chimera-org/chimera_v2.0
```

For specific modules or components:

```
Chimera Project. (YYYY). [Component Name] [Software module]. In Chimera v[version number]. https://github.com/chimera-org/chimera_v2.0/path/to/component
```

### Dataset Citation

For datasets used or produced by the Chimera project:

```
[Creator(s)]. (YYYY). [Dataset Title] [Data set]. Chimera Project. https://doi.org/[DOI] or [URL]
```

Include version information when available:

```
[Creator(s)]. (YYYY). [Dataset Title] (Version [version number]) [Data set]. Chimera Project. https://doi.org/[DOI] or [URL]
```

### Academic Publication Citation

For journal articles, follow the APA 7th Edition format:

```
[Author(s)]. (YYYY). [Title of article]. [Journal Name], [Volume](Issue), [Page range]. https://doi.org/[DOI]
```

For conference papers:

```
[Author(s)]. (YYYY, Month). [Title of paper]. Paper presented at [Conference Name], [Location]. https://doi.org/[DOI] or [URL]
```

### Technical Documentation and Standards

For citing technical standards (ISO, IEEE, etc.):

```
[Standards Organization]. (YYYY). [Standard designation and title]. Retrieved from [URL]
```

Example:
```
International Organization for Standardization. (2016). ISO 13485:2016 Medical devices — Quality management systems — Requirements for regulatory purposes. Retrieved from https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html
```

### FDA and Regulatory Documentation

For FDA guidance documents:

```
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (YYYY). [Title of guidance]. [Document number if available]. Retrieved from [URL]
```

For Code of Federal Regulations:

```
[Title number] C.F.R. § [Section number] (YYYY).
```

Example:
```
21 C.F.R. § 820 (2022).
```

## In-Text Citations

For in-text citations, use the author-date system:

- Single author: (Smith, 2022)
- Two authors: (Smith & Jones, 2022)
- Three or more authors: (Smith et al., 2022)
- Organization as author: (Chimera Project, 2022)
- Direct quote: (Smith, 2022, p. 45)

For multiple citations in the same parentheses, arrange chronologically and separate with semicolons:
(Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021; Brown, 2022)

## Self-Citation and Project Attribution

When publishing work that builds upon or utilizes the Chimera platform:

1. Include a citation to the main Chimera project repository
2. Specify the version of Chimera used
3. Acknowledge specific components or modules utilized
4. Include a statement in the acknowledgments section recognizing the Chimera project's contribution

Example acknowledgment:
"This research utilized the Chimera v2.0 platform (https://github.com/chimera-org/chimera_v2.0), an open-source neural interface system designed for medical applications."

## Citation Management

The Chimera project recommends using citation management software such as Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote to maintain consistent citations. Project-specific citation styles are available in the `/docs/citation_styles/` directory.

## Open Access and Preprints

The Chimera project encourages:

1. Citing the final published version of a paper when available
2. Including DOIs for all citations when available
3. Using preprint server citations (arXiv, bioRxiv, etc.) when the final publication is not yet available
4. Prioritizing open access resources when possible

## Regulatory and Compliance Citations

For regulatory compliance documentation:

1. Always cite the most current version of regulatory standards
2. Include the effective date of regulatory guidance
3. Specify the regulatory jurisdiction (FDA, EMA, etc.)
4. Note any specific sections or paragraphs referenced

## Version Control

This citation guideline document follows semantic versioning:

- Current version: 1.0.0
- Last updated: April 2025
- Document owner: Chimera Research Team

Changes to this document will be tracked in the project's version control system.
