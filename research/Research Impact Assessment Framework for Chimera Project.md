## Introduction

This Research Impact Assessment Framework establishes a comprehensive approach for evaluating, measuring, and communicating the multi-dimensional impact of the Chimera project. As an Indian startup developing a brain-controlled exoskeleton for home use without professional supervision after training, Chimera aims to create transformative impact across clinical, economic, social, and technological domains.

The framework is designed to support billion-dollar funding readiness by demonstrating a sophisticated approach to impact assessment that aligns with international best practices while addressing India-specific considerations. It provides structured guidance for researchers, clinicians, engineers, business leaders, and stakeholders to understand, measure, and maximize the project's impact throughout its lifecycle.

## Impact Assessment Philosophy

### Guiding Principles

1. **Holistic Perspective**: Evaluate impact across multiple dimensions beyond traditional metrics
2. **Evidence-Based Approach**: Ground impact assessment in rigorous data collection and analysis
3. **Stakeholder Inclusivity**: Incorporate diverse perspectives in defining and measuring impact
4. **Continuous Learning**: Use impact assessment for ongoing improvement and adaptation
5. **Transparency**: Maintain open communication about methods, findings, and limitations
6. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect diverse values and contexts in impact evaluation
7. **Long-Term Vision**: Consider both immediate outcomes and sustained long-term impact

### Theoretical Foundations

The framework integrates multiple theoretical perspectives:

1. **Theory of Change**: Mapping causal pathways from activities to outcomes and impacts
2. **Social Return on Investment**: Quantifying social, environmental, and economic value creation
3. **Capability Approach**: Assessing impact on human capabilities and freedoms
4. **Systems Thinking**: Understanding complex interactions and emergent effects
5. **Participatory Evaluation**: Engaging stakeholders in defining and measuring impact
6. **Technology Assessment**: Evaluating technological innovations' broader implications
7. **Health Technology Assessment**: Assessing clinical, economic, and social dimensions of health technologies
