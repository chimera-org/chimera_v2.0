## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines Chimera's comprehensive approach to compliance with 21 CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulation (QSR) for our brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled exoskeleton system. The Quality System Regulation establishes the framework for design, manufacturing, and distribution of medical devices in the United States.

Chimera has implemented a robust Quality Management System (QMS) that aligns with both 21 CFR Part 820 and ISO 13485:2016 requirements. This document maps our QMS processes to specific QSR requirements, identifies our implementation approach, and provides evidence of compliance to support our regulatory submissions and billion-dollar funding goals.

Our QMS is designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the Chimera BCI-controlled exoskeleton through systematic control of design, development, production, and distribution processes. This document demonstrates our commitment to regulatory compliance and quality excellence.

## 2. Quality Management System Overview

### 2.1 QMS Structure

Chimera's Quality Management System is structured to meet the requirements of both 21 CFR Part 820 and ISO 13485:2016, with the following key components:

1. **Quality Manual**: Defines our quality policy, objectives, and overall QMS structure
2. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Detailed procedures for all quality-related activities
3. **Work Instructions**: Step-by-step instructions for specific tasks
4. **Forms and Templates**: Standardized documents for recording quality activities
5. **Quality Records**: Documented evidence of QMS implementation
