## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines Chimera's comprehensive approach to compliance with India's Medical Devices Rules, 2017 (MDR 2017) and Schedule 5 Quality Management System requirements for our brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled exoskeleton system. The MDR 2017 establishes the framework for design, manufacturing, and distribution of medical devices in India.

Chimera, as an Indian startup, has implemented a robust Quality Management System (QMS) that aligns with both MDR 2017 and ISO 13485:2016 requirements. This document maps our QMS processes to specific MDR 2017 requirements, identifies our implementation approach, and provides evidence of compliance to support our regulatory submissions and billion-dollar funding goals.

Our QMS is designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the Chimera BCI-controlled exoskeleton through systematic control of design, development, production, and distribution processes, with specific considerations for home use without professional supervision after training. This document demonstrates our commitment to regulatory compliance and quality excellence in the Indian market.

## 2. Quality Management System Overview

### 2.1 QMS Structure

Chimera's Quality Management System is structured to meet the requirements of both MDR 2017 Schedule 5 and ISO 13485:2016, with the following key components:

1. **Quality Manual**: Defines our quality policy, objectives, and overall QMS structure
2. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Detailed procedures for all quality-related activities
3. **Work Instructions**: Step-by-step instructions for specific tasks
4. **Forms and Templates**: Standardized documents for recording quality activities
5. **Quality Records**: Documented evidence of QMS implementation
