## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines Chimera's comprehensive regulatory strategy for obtaining FDA clearance/approval for our brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled exoskeleton system. The Chimera platform represents a novel combination of BCI technology and powered exoskeleton hardware, designed to restore mobility for individuals with quadriplegia and other severe mobility impairments.

Based on thorough analysis of FDA regulations, guidance documents, and precedent devices, we have determined that the Chimera system will be regulated as a **Class II medical device** requiring **510(k) clearance** for the initial version, with potential **De Novo classification** for novel aspects of the technology. Our AI/ML components will follow the FDA's evolving framework for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) with predetermined change control plans.

This strategy document provides a roadmap for regulatory compliance throughout the product development lifecycle, from design controls through post-market surveillance, with specific attention to the unique regulatory considerations for BCI technology and AI/ML-enabled medical devices.

## 2. Product Classification and Regulatory Pathway

### 2.1 Device Description

The Chimera system consists of two primary components:
1. **BCI Component**: Non-invasive EEG-based brain-computer interface that processes neural signals to decode movement intentions
2. **Exoskeleton Component**: Powered exoskeleton that translates decoded neural signals into physical movement assistance

### 2.2 Intended Use Statement

"The Chimera BCI-Controlled Exoskeleton is intended to assist in the rehabilitation and mobility of patients with mobility impairments due to spinal cord injury, stroke, or other neurological conditions. The device is intended for use in clinical settings under the supervision of trained healthcare professionals."

### 2.3 Indications for Use

The Chimera BCI-Controlled Exoskeleton is indicated for use by individuals with:
- Spinal cord injuries at levels C5 to T12
- Stroke with hemiparesis
- Other neurological conditions resulting in mobility impairments
- Height between 5'2" and 6'2" (157-188 cm)
- Weight up to 220 lbs (100 kg)

The device is intended for use in:
- Rehabilitation facilities
- Clinical settings
- Home use (with proper training and under periodic clinical supervision)

### 2.4 Device Classification

Based on our analysis of FDA product codes and precedent devices:

| Component | Classification | Product Code | Regulation Number | Device Class |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Exoskeleton | Powered Exoskeleton | PHL | 21 CFR 890.3480 | Class II |
| BCI Software | Neurology Software | QJK | 21 CFR 882.5050 | Class II |

### 2.5 Regulatory Pathway

Our regulatory pathway strategy follows a phased approach:

1. **Initial Clearance (Phase 1)**: 510(k) clearance for the exoskeleton component with limited BCI functionality, leveraging substantial equivalence to existing cleared powered exoskeletons
   
2. **BCI Enhancement (Phase 2)**: De Novo classification request for advanced BCI features that exceed the capabilities of predicate devices
   
3. **AI/ML Implementation (Phase 3)**: Predetermined Change Control Plan for AI/ML components following FDA's proposed regulatory framework for AI/ML-based SaMD

## 3. Predicate Device Analysis
