## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines Chimera's comprehensive regulatory strategy for obtaining Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) approval for our brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled exoskeleton system in India. The Chimera platform represents a novel combination of BCI technology and powered exoskeleton hardware, designed to restore mobility for individuals with quadriplegia and other severe mobility impairments for use in daily social life without professional supervision after training.

Based on thorough analysis of Indian Medical Devices Rules 2017, CDSCO guidance documents, and precedent devices, we have determined that the Chimera system will be regulated as a **Class C medical device** (moderate-high risk) requiring manufacturing and import licenses from CDSCO. Our AI/ML components will follow the evolving framework for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) with predetermined change control plans.

This strategy document provides a roadmap for regulatory compliance throughout the product development lifecycle, from design controls through post-market surveillance, with specific attention to the unique regulatory considerations for BCI technology, AI/ML-enabled medical devices, and home use requirements in India.

## 2. Product Classification and Regulatory Pathway

### 2.1 Device Description

The Chimera system consists of two primary components:
1. **BCI Component**: Non-invasive EEG-based brain-computer interface that processes neural signals to decode movement intentions
2. **Exoskeleton Component**: Powered exoskeleton that translates decoded neural signals into physical movement assistance

### 2.2 Intended Use Statement

"The Chimera BCI-Controlled Exoskeleton is intended to assist in the mobility of patients with mobility impairments due to spinal cord injury, stroke, or other neurological conditions. The device is intended for home use in daily social life without professional supervision after appropriate training."

### 2.3 Indications for Use
