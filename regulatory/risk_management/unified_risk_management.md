## üéØ Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

This Unified Risk Management Plan establishes a comprehensive framework for identifying, analyzing, evaluating, controlling, and monitoring risks associated with the Chimera neural interface system throughout its entire lifecycle. This plan integrates requirements from both US FDA and Indian CDSCO regulatory frameworks while adhering to international standards, particularly ISO 14971:2019.

### Scope

This document applies to:

- All components of the Chimera neural interface system
- All phases of the product lifecycle from concept to post-market
- All geographical markets, with specific focus on US and Indian requirements
- All organizational functions involved in product development and support
- All risk types including technical, clinical, usability, and cybersecurity risks
- All deployment environments including clinical, research, and home use settings

## üåê Regulatory Framework Integration

### Harmonized Standards Approach

This Unified Risk Management Plan is based on the following harmonized approach:

1. **Foundation Standard**: ISO 14971:2019 "Medical devices ‚Äî Application of risk management to medical devices" serves as the foundational framework
2. **US Regulatory Alignment**: Incorporates FDA requirements from:
   - 21 CFR 820.30(g) Design Validation
   - FDA Guidance on "Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices"
   - FDA Guidance on "Content of Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices"
   - FDA Guidance on "Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices"
3. **Indian Regulatory Alignment**: Incorporates CDSCO requirements from:
   - Medical Device Rules, 2017 (as amended)
   - CDSCO Guidelines for Software as Medical Device (SaMD)
   - CDSCO Guidelines on Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices
   - Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
4. **International Harmonization**: Aligns with:
   - IMDRF guidance documents on SaMD and risk categorization
   - IEC 62304 for software lifecycle processes
   - IEC 62366-1 for usability engineering
   - ISO 13485:2016 for quality management systems
   - ISO/TR 24971:2020 for guidance on ISO 14971

### Cross-Market Strategy

This unified approach enables:

1. **Simultaneous Regulatory Submissions**: Preparation of submission packages for FDA and CDSCO in parallel
2. **Consistent Risk Documentation**: Standardized risk documentation acceptable to both regulatory bodies
3. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Elimination of duplicate risk management activities
4. **Global Market Access**: Foundation for expansion to additional markets beyond US and India
5. **Investor Confidence**: Demonstration of comprehensive regulatory strategy suitable for billion-dollar funding

## üîÑ Risk Management Process

### Process Overview

The risk management process follows the ISO 14971:2019 framework with enhancements to address FDA and CDSCO requirements:

![Risk Management Process](https://example.com/risk_management_process.png)

1. **Risk Management Planning**: Establishing the risk management process
2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Risk identification
   - Risk analysis
   - Risk evaluation
3. **Risk Control**:
   - Risk control option analysis
   - Risk control implementation
   - Residual risk evaluation
4. **Overall Residual Risk Evaluation**
5. **Risk Management Review**
6. **Production and Post-Production Activities**

### Risk Acceptability Criteria

Risk acceptability will be determined using a harmonized approach that satisfies both FDA and CDSCO expectations:

#### Severity Categories

| Level | Category | Definition | Examples |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| 5 | Catastrophic | Results in patient death | Fatal electric shock, fatal brain hemorrhage |
| 4 | Critical | Results in permanent impairment or life-threatening injury | Permanent neurological damage, severe brain injury |
| 3 | Serious | Results in injury or impairment requiring medical intervention | Seizure, infection requiring antibiotics, burns |
| 2 | Minor | Results in temporary injury or impairment not requiring medical intervention | Skin irritation, headache, temporary discomfort |
| 1 | Negligible | Inconvenience or temporary discomfort | Mild discomfort, delayed therapy, cosmetic issue |

#### Probability Categories

| Level | Category | Definition | Quantitative Range |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| 5 | Frequent | Likely to occur often | > 10^-3 |
| 4 | Probable | Likely to occur several times | 10^-3 to 10^-4 |
| 3 | Occasional | Likely to occur sometime | 10^-4 to 10^-5 |
| 2 | Remote | Unlikely but possible to occur | 10^-5 to 10^-6 |
| 1 | Improbable | So unlikely that it can be assumed occurrence may not be experienced | < 10^-6 |

#### Risk Acceptability Matrix

| Severity ‚Üí <br> Probability ‚Üì | 1-Negligible | 2-Minor | 3-Serious | 4-Critical | 5-Catastrophic |
|-------------------------------|--------------|---------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 5-Frequent | Acceptable with Justification | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Unacceptable |
| 4-Probable | Acceptable with Justification | Acceptable with Justification | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Unacceptable |
| 3-Occasional | Acceptable | Acceptable with Justification | Acceptable with Justification | Unacceptable | Unacceptable |
| 2-Remote | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable with Justification | Acceptable with Justification | Unacceptable |
| 1-Improbable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable with Justification | Acceptable with Justification |

**Definitions**:
- **Acceptable**: Risk is considered acceptable without additional controls
- **Acceptable with Justification**: Risk may be acceptable if benefits outweigh risks and further risk reduction is impractical
- **Unacceptable**: Risk must be reduced through additional controls

### Risk Control Hierarchy

Risk controls will be implemented according to the following hierarchy:

1. **Inherent Safety by Design**: Eliminate hazards through design features
2. **Protective Measures**: Implement safety mechanisms and barriers
3. **Information for Safety**: Provide warnings, labels, and training

For each identified risk, controls from multiple levels of the hierarchy will be considered to ensure robust risk mitigation.
