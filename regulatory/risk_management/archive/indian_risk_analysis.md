## 1. Executive Summary

This Risk Analysis document presents a comprehensive assessment of potential hazards, hazardous situations, and harms associated with the Chimera Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) controlled exoskeleton system. The analysis follows the methodology outlined in ISO 14971:2019 and aligns with Indian Medical Devices Rules, 2017 requirements for risk management of Class C medical devices.

The analysis identifies 112 potential hazards across eight major categories: BCI component hazards, exoskeleton component hazards, software hazards, user interface hazards, environmental hazards, use-related hazards, home use hazards, and India-specific infrastructure hazards. Each hazard has been systematically analyzed to determine potential hazardous situations, harms, and initial risk levels before implementing risk controls.

Key findings from this risk analysis include:
- 15 Very High initial risk items requiring immediate risk control implementation
- 35 High initial risk items requiring significant risk control measures
- 42 Medium initial risk items requiring reasonable risk control measures
- 20 Low initial risk items requiring minimal or no additional risk controls

This document serves as a foundation for the risk control process and supports our billion-dollar funding goals by demonstrating a thorough understanding of device risks and a commitment to patient safety in the Indian home use context.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Risk Analysis is to:
- Identify all reasonably foreseeable hazards associated with the Chimera BCI-controlled exoskeleton

- Provide a basis for risk control measures
- Document the risk analysis process in compliance with regulatory requirements
- Address specific risks related to home use without professional supervision
- Address specific risks related to the Indian operating environment

### 2.2 Scope

This Risk Analysis covers:
- All components of the Chimera BCI-controlled exoskeleton system
- All intended uses and reasonably foreseeable misuses
- All phases of the product lifecycle
- All user types (patients, family members, caregivers)
- All use environments (home settings, outdoor environments)
- India-specific infrastructure and environmental considerations
- Unsupervised use after initial training

### 2.3 Methodology

This Risk Analysis employs the following methodologies:
- Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)

- Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) for critical components
- Use Error Analysis
- Software Hazard Analysis
- Cybersecurity Threat Modeling
- Home Environment Assessment
- Infrastructure Vulnerability Analysis
- Cultural and Regional Factors Analysis

### 2.4 Risk Estimation Parameters

Risk estimation is based on the following parameters:

**Severity Levels:**
- 1 (Negligible): Inconvenience or temporary discomfort
- 2 (Minor): Temporary injury or impairment not requiring medical intervention
- 3 (Moderate): Injury or impairment requiring medical intervention
- 4 (Major): Permanent impairment or life-threatening injury
- 5 (Catastrophic): Death or permanent severe disability

**Probability Levels:**
- 1 (Improbable): < 1 in 100,000
- 2 (Remote): 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000
- 3 (Occasional): 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000
- 4 (Probable): 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000
- 5 (Frequent): > 1 in 100

**Risk Levels:**
- Low (Green): Acceptable without additional controls
- Medium (Yellow): ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable)
- High (Orange): Unacceptable without significant risk reduction
- Very High (Red): Unacceptable, requires immediate action

## 6. Conclusion

This comprehensive risk analysis has identified 112 potential hazards across eight categories that could affect the safe and effective operation of the Chimera BCI-controlled exoskeleton in Indian home use environments. The analysis reveals several critical risk areas requiring particular attention:

1. **Power and Connectivity Challenges**: The Indian infrastructure presents significant challenges related to power reliability, voltage fluctuations, and internet connectivity that could impact device safety and performance.

2. **Environmental Factors**: India's diverse climate conditions, including extreme heat, high humidity during monsoon season, and high dust environments, pose unique risks to device components and operation.

3. **Home Use Without Supervision**: The intended use without professional supervision after training introduces risks related to proper device application, emergency response, and ongoing proper use.

4. **Cultural and Regional Factors**: Language diversity, literacy levels, and varied living conditions across India require special consideration in user interface design and training programs.

5. **Physical Environment Challenges**: Uneven terrain, limited space in many homes, and varied infrastructure quality present operational risks that must be addressed.

The identified risks will serve as the foundation for developing comprehensive risk control measures that specifically address the Indian context and home use scenario. These controls will be documented in the Risk Controls document and will be essential for ensuring the safe and effective use of the Chimera BCI-controlled exoskeleton in its intended use environment.
