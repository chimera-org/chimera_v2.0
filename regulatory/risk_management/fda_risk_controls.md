## 1. Executive Summary

This Risk Controls document outlines the comprehensive measures implemented to mitigate the risks identified in the Risk Analysis for the Chimera Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) controlled exoskeleton system. Following the methodology established in ISO 14971:2019, this document details specific risk control measures, their implementation, verification, and the resulting residual risk evaluation.

The risk control strategy follows the priority order established in ISO 14971:
1. Inherent safety by design
2. Protective measures in the device or manufacturing process
3. Information for safety (e.g., warnings, contraindications)

For the 87 risks identified in the Risk Analysis, we have implemented 142 distinct risk control measures. After implementation of these controls:
- All Very High risks have been reduced to Medium or Low
- All High risks have been reduced to Medium or Low
- All Medium risks have been evaluated for further reduction where practicable
- The overall residual risk has been determined to be acceptable

This document demonstrates our commitment to patient safety and regulatory compliance, supporting our billion-dollar funding goals by showing a thorough approach to risk management.

## 2. Introduction

## 3. Risk Control Process

### 3.1 Risk Control Option Analysis

For each identified risk, the following process was followed to determine appropriate risk control measures:

1. **Risk Control Option Identification**:
   - Brainstorming sessions with cross-functional teams
   - Review of similar device risk controls
   - Analysis of applicable standards and regulations
   - Consultation with clinical experts

2. **Risk Control Option Evaluation**:
   - Technical feasibility assessment
   - Implementation cost and timeline analysis
   - Impact on device usability and performance
   - Potential for introducing new risks

3. **Risk Control Selection**:
   - Selection based on effectiveness in reducing risk
   - Prioritization according to risk control hierarchy
   - Consideration of multiple controls for high-risk items
   - Evaluation of control combinations for synergistic effects

### 3.2 Risk Control Implementation

Implementation of risk controls followed this process:

1. **Design Specification**:
   - Detailed specification of each risk control measure
   - Integration into design requirements
   - Design review and approval

2. **Implementation**:
   - Development according to specifications
   - Documentation of implementation details
   - Change control process for design modifications

3. **Verification**:
   - Testing to confirm implementation according to specifications
   - Documentation of verification results
   - Review and approval of verification evidence

### 3.3 Residual Risk Evaluation

After implementation of risk controls, residual risks were evaluated:

1. **Individual Residual Risk Evaluation**:
   - Re-estimation of severity and probability
   - Determination of residual risk level
   - Comparison to risk acceptability criteria

2. **Risk-Benefit Analysis**:
   - Evaluation of residual risks against clinical benefits
   - Consideration of available alternatives
   - Determination of overall risk acceptability

3. **Overall Residual Risk Evaluation**:
   - Aggregate assessment of all residual risks
   - Consideration of risk interactions
   - Final determination of overall risk acceptability

### 10.2 Residual Risk Acceptability

All residual risks have been evaluated against the acceptability criteria defined in the Risk Management Plan:

- **Low Risk**: Acceptable without further consideration
- **Medium Risk**: Acceptable with documented justification (ALARP principle)
- **High Risk**: Unacceptable without significant risk reduction
- **Very High Risk**: Unacceptable, requires immediate action

All residual risks are now in the Low or Medium categories, with no High or Very High risks remaining. The 15 Medium risks have been evaluated according to the ALARP principle and determined to be acceptable based on:

1. Technical limitations preventing further risk reduction
2. Potential introduction of new risks by additional controls
3. Negative impact on device usability or therapeutic benefit
4. Benefit-risk analysis showing clear benefit despite residual risk

### 10.3 Overall Residual Risk Evaluation

The overall residual risk of the Chimera BCI-controlled exoskeleton has been evaluated by considering:

1. The aggregate of all individual residual risks
2. The potential for risk interactions
3. The clinical benefits provided by the device
4. Available alternatives for the target patient population
5. State of the art for similar medical devices

Based on this evaluation, the overall residual risk is determined to be **acceptable** because:

1. All individual risks have been reduced to acceptable levels
2. The clinical benefits of mobility restoration outweigh the residual risks
3. The device incorporates state-of-the-art safety features
4. Alternative treatments have similar or greater risks
5. The device meets or exceeds safety standards for similar devices

2. **Risk Analysis Updates**: Updates based on newly identified hazards
3. **Risk Control Effectiveness**: Evaluation of risk control effectiveness
4. **Residual Risk Re-evaluation**: Re-evaluation of residual risks
5. **Corrective Actions**: Implementation of additional risk controls if needed

### 12.3 Production and Post-Production Risk Management Integration

The integration between production and post-production risk management includes:

1. **Feedback Loop**: Mechanism to incorporate post-production information into risk management
2. **Change Management**: Process for implementing changes based on post-production information
3. **Trend Analysis**: Analysis of trends in post-production information
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Process for continuous improvement of risk controls

## 13. Conclusion

This Risk Controls document demonstrates the comprehensive approach taken to mitigate risks associated with the Chimera BCI-controlled exoskeleton system. Through the implementation of 142 risk control measures, all identified risks have been reduced to acceptable levels, with no High or Very High risks remaining.

The risk control strategy has followed the priority order established in ISO 14971, with emphasis on inherent safety by design wherever possible. The effectiveness of all risk control measures has been verified through appropriate testing methods.

The overall residual risk has been determined to be acceptable based on the clinical benefits provided by the device and comparison to available alternatives. A robust post-production risk management process has been established to ensure ongoing risk management throughout the device lifecycle.

This comprehensive approach to risk management supports our billion-dollar funding goals by demonstrating our commitment to patient safety and regulatory compliance, which are critical factors for investors in the medical device space.
