### 3.2 Risk Management Planning

Risk management planning includes:

- Defining the scope of risk management activities
- Assigning responsibilities
- Establishing risk acceptability criteria
- Planning verification activities
- Defining review requirements
- Establishing documentation requirements

### 3.3 Risk Analysis

Risk analysis will be conducted using the following methods:

- Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)
- Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
- Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) for critical systems
- Use-related risk analysis
- Software Hazard Analysis
- Cybersecurity threat modeling

The risk analysis will consider:

- Intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse
- Identification of characteristics related to safety
- Identification of hazards and hazardous situations
- Estimation of risks for each hazardous situation

### 3.4 Risk Evaluation

Risk evaluation will be performed by comparing estimated risks against risk acceptability criteria. Risks will be categorized as:

- Acceptable (no further risk reduction required)
- As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) (acceptable with justification)
- Unacceptable (must be reduced)

### 3.5 Risk Control

Risk control measures will be implemented in the following order of priority:

1. Inherent safety by design
2. Protective measures in the device or manufacturing process
3. Information for safety (e.g., warnings, contraindications)

All risk control measures will be verified for implementation and effectiveness.

### 3.6 Residual Risk Evaluation

After implementation of risk control measures, residual risks will be evaluated to determine if they are acceptable according to the defined criteria. The overall residual risk will also be evaluated to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks.

### 3.7 Risk Management Review

Formal risk management reviews will be conducted at the following milestones:

- Completion of initial risk analysis
- Completion of design phase
- Completion of verification and validation
- Prior to commercial release
- When significant changes are made to the device
- Periodically during post-market surveillance

### 3.8 Production and Post-Production Information

A system will be established to collect and review production and post-production information that may impact risk management. This includes:

- User feedback
- Complaints
- Adverse events
- Regulatory reporting
- Scientific literature
- Post-market clinical follow-up
