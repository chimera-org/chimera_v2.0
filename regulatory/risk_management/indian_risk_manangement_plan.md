All risk control measures will be verified for implementation and effectiveness, with special attention to controls addressing home use risks.

### 3.6 Residual Risk Evaluation

After implementation of risk control measures, residual risks will be evaluated to determine if they are acceptable according to the defined criteria. The overall residual risk will also be evaluated to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks, with particular focus on home use without professional supervision.

### 3.7 Risk Management Review

Formal risk management reviews will be conducted at the following milestones:

- Completion of initial risk analysis
- Completion of design phase
- Completion of verification and validation
- Prior to commercial release
- When significant changes are made to the device
- Periodically during post-market surveillance
- After initial home use deployment phase

### 3.8 Production and Post-Production Information

A system will be established to collect and review production and post-production information that may impact risk management. This includes:

- User feedback
- Complaints
- Adverse events
- Regulatory reporting
- Scientific literature
- Post-market clinical follow-up
- Home use experience reports
- Remote monitoring data
